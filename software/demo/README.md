# demo folder

Here are the old files written by the legacy Tapster team placed in the "src" folder of the "software" part.
You can find here demos and some samples of uses of the bot.
But honestly they are a bit... dusty.

## Some commands write

### Make some drawings

```shell
  $ node bot.js
      > draw.test()
      > draw.drawSquare(50)
      > draw.drawCircle()
      > draw.drawStar()
      > draw.drawTriangle(10, 10, 150, 50, 350, 350)
      > go( 0, 0, -140)
      > go( 0, 0, -155)
      > go( 20, 30, -155)
      > go(100, 150, -155)
      > svg.drawSVG("assets/helloEnT.svg")
      > svg.drawSVG("assets/shrug.svg")
```
