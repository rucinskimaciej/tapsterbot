# Tapster - Mobile Automation Robot

![A Taspter2 bot](poster.png)

## Why using such bot?
- Bring fun in your office
- Bring automation for your tests
- Extend your software-based instrumented tests (using UI Automator, Espresso, Kakao, Appium or whatever) with hardware-based tests
- Deal with secured elements on which no software can click
- Be as close as possible of the ideal use case (users use their fingers to click :3)
- Get a new tool for software development and mobile app tests: robots!
