# client folder

Here are elements defining clients which allow user to drive the Tapster 2 bot.  

If you want to use this client, you have to have ['requests'](docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/ "Requests module") module installed.
To do so, you can run the following command or read this [topic](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17309288/importerror-no-module-named-requests "Stack Overflox post"):

```shell
  sudo pip install requests
```
