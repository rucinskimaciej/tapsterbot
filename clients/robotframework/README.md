Here are elements defining [Robot Framework](http://robotframework.org/ "Robot Framework homepage") keywords to integrate into test cases.

## List of files
  - _config.robot_ The configuration file used in the one containing keywords
  - _tapster_keywords.robot_ The file containing the keywords to integrate in your test cases, using the configuration file
  - _tapster_wrapper.robot_ The wrapper using Tapster and Appium keywords to bring more abstraction for tests
  - _demo/tapster_demo.robot_ Just a file with test cases using the keywords and the configuration defined in the other files.

## How to use the client
  1. Thirst you need to install on your computer these libraries so send HTTP requests (for the keywords) and use Appium (for the wrapper)
  ```shell
    pip install -U requests
    pip install -U robotframework-requests
    pip install robotframework-appiumlibrary 
  ```
