Here are the files, datasets and clients created so as to provide an assistant based on [Snips.ai](https://snips.ai/ "Web site of Snips.ai") with natural language understanding (NLU),
speech recognition (ASR) and interaction with the Tapster 2 robot.  
The Snips assistants are in _assistant-english_ and _assistant-french_ folders.  
The slots (i.e. some kinds of variables) and the training samples are in the _data_ folder.  

The Snips' NLU engine's version is **0.12.0**
