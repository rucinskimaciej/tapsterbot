Here are the files, datasets and clients created so as to provide an assistant based on [Snips.ai](https://snips.ai/ "Web site of Snips.ai") with natural language understanding (NLU) and speech recognition (ASR) engines.  
The Snips assistants are in _assistant-english_ and _assistant-french_ folders.  
The slots (i.e. some kinds of variables) and the training samples are in the _data_ folder.  

Be aware there is no logic about the Tapster robot here. Only the assistant is defined is this location, and you should integrate it and bind it to the logic of your client or platform (Android, web, Raspberry, etc).  

The Snips' NLU engine's version is **0.12.0**

You can find the _Tapster2 commands (french)_ on the Snips store: https://console.snips.ai/store/fr/bundle_PPn5qxGGbBQ
