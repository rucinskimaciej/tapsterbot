# web

Here are the assets to build a Progressive Web App (as a Single Page Application) so as to drive the Tapster2 robot.
Because nowadays tools are used (ES 6, HTML5, CSS3, Service Workers, etc), you should use an up-to-date web browser ;-)
The web app sends to the robot's server HTTP requests to make it execute actions.

## Install the app

Just configure a web browser and host the sources inside it :)

## The look of the app
